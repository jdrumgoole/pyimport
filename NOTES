15-Jun-2016 : Event storm you application. Capture all your commands.

13-Jun : Switched to insert_many. Inserts now at 3000 per second.
 
12-Jun : One process per file. 12000 inserts per second. 

12-Jun : Single process file does 6000 inserts per second

***
The queue seems to be a problem as a single threaded solution is running 6 times faster than a mult-threaded one. 1000 inserts
a second vs 6000 a second.

Need to try with each process running a reader and writer (e.g. the processFile function).
